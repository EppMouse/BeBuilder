BeBuilder is a GUI builder and C++ Generator for BeOS. <BR>
The code generated in BeBuilder is without any overhead, nor library nor statically linked resources.<br>
The code is <b>PURE</b>, only C++ and BeOS API. <br>
<b>BeBuilder generates code as you would write it!</b><br>
<br>
If you are not statisfied by BeBuilder you can do what you want with the source code generated... no overhead, no library, no resource... just simple Object Oriented C++ code. <br>
In those times of <i>"OPEN stuff (tm)"</i> BeBuilder is open minded! You will never be stuck with it!
