<HR>
BeBuilder V0.5 is still a pre release. We are still interested in any comments, even the bad ones. :-)
<UL>
	<LI><B>All the BControl included in the BeOS Documentation</B><P>
	As we said since BeBuilder V0.1 we are working hard to add all the components included in BeOS, into BeBuilder. It's just a question of time! 8D
		<P>
		

<LI><B>Project Options</B><P>
	Since V0.5 you can save and load projects.
<P>
		
<LI><B>GCC Integration</B><P>
	The <i>Tools</i> menu has been upgraded but is still <b><i>experimental</i></b> you can make, run and edit your files from BeBuilder, sorry for the Pe and Eddie lovers only the BeIDE is supported for the moment.
<P>

<LI><B>Dynamic Code Generation</B><P>
As you might certainly have noticed there is no more<i>Generate</i> option in the menu. Since V0.5 the code generation is dynamic as soon as you drop a component or modify a property the source code is modified and your modifications <b>should</b> not be lost. <br>
I said <b>should</b> to take no risks but BeBuilder is developed with BeBuilder...<br>
<b> RULE OF THUMB : NEVER EVER MODIFY A CODE LINE WRITTEN BY BEBUILDER.</b>
<P>

<LI><B>Bugs</B><P>
You may find  bugs... :) don't hesitate to E-mail me concerning those bugs and if possible include a description or a simple project that crashes BeBuilder
<P>

<LI><B>Future Editor</B><P>
	We hope to create a simple editor which source code will be provided to support some cool features of BeBuilder.
<P>

<LI><B>Openings</B><P>
		For the moment the code generation is only C++ but we could imagine to add other
		languages.... make your choice!
